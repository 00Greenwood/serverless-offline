REQUEST TEMPLATE
This is the default request template file. You can use this file to add a velocity template you want to use for all requests.

http://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.7/user-guide.html

You can also override this with function specific velocity templates.
You will have to place function specific templates in the same directory as your function and add the .req.vm extension to the filename.
For example:
if your function is named: helloworld.js
your request template should be: helloworld.req.vm
